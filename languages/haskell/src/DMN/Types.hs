-- INSIGHT
-- input columns always evaluate to a boolean somehow
--   usually this is something like ">= 21"
--   but it could be be something like "age.isAdult" which has a boolean value
-- output columns can evaluate to any value type, typically "lentil soup" but sometimes a function [2..10]

-- proposal1 add a new type DMN_Enum
--         2 add a new type DMN_FEEL, which can be one of

                                      -- a feel expression like       2
